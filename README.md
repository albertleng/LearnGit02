## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work
on a project at the same time. It is designed to handle everything from small to
very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Installation

Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your
computer. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it on your
machine.

## Git Commands

Here are some of the most commonly used Git commands:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git add`: Adds a file to the staging area.
- `git commit`: Commits the file to the repository.
- `git status`: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working
  directory.
- `git push`: Pushes your changes to the remote repository.

## GitHub Authentication

GitHub provides several ways to authenticate, including using a username and
password, SSH keys, and personal access tokens. For enhanced security, it is
recommended to use personal access tokens or SSH keys.

## Branching Strategies

There are several common Git branching strategies, including feature branching,
Gitflow, and trunk-based development. Each has its own advantages and is suited
to different types of projects.
